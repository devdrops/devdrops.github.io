Hi!

I'm Davi Marcondes Moreira, a software developer based on Brazil. I've been working with software development since 2009, and my passions are my work and help people being happy with their work.

I'm a software developer, speaker (more at the [talks](/talks) area :D) and Zend Certified Engineer for PHP 5.3, and I describe myself as a web development enthusiast.
