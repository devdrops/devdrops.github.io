Antes de Seguir&amp;hellip; As instruÃ§Ãµes aqui informam dicas de como usar autenticaÃ§Ã£o para download de dependÃªncias com Composer. Meu foco maior Ã© usando Docker e Docker Compose, mas os comandos em essÃªncia podem ser usados em qualquer ambiente.

      <description>Hi! In this short post I&amp;rsquo;ll describe the steps I&amp;rsquo;ve made, with the great help of a work colleague, on how to achieve the combination of these great tools together: NetBeans, Xdebug and Vagrant.
The following steps were executed in a vagrant box using Ubuntu, and with the Yosemite as the OS for the hosting machine.
Xdebug Xdebug is one of the most amazing tools for any PHP developer. Consider yourself in the following situation: you have your code base, developed under some framework, and you have some few bugs while developing new features.</description>

      <description>Recently on it&amp;rsquo;s version 8.0 (note: there&amp;rsquo;s a new stable release, NetBeans 8.0.1 at the present moment), the NetBeans IDE highlighted some new resources for PHP projects. One of the most interesting is the extension for PHP Coding Standards Fixer (A.K.A. PHP CS Fixer).
What is the PHP CS Fixer: a brief explanation For those who didn&amp;rsquo;t heard about PHP CS Fixer before (/me included), it&amp;rsquo;s pretty easy: it&amp;rsquo;s a tool to evaluate and apply fixes into your PHP code, according to the famous PHP code standards well know as PSR (PHP Standard Recomendation, as described at the PHP FIG site).</description>

      <description>In this first post, I&amp;rsquo;ll share my basic experience in how to use an important tool to assure and verify your code quality.
Special thanks to Tomas Mysik and Adam McAuley for their efforts on Bugzilla and the NetBeans PHP Mailing List, which helped me a lot on how to use these combined tools, and then create this tutorial.
Requirements PHP &amp;gt;= 5.3 NetBeans 7.4 PEAR Note: I&amp;rsquo;m assuming you already have an HTTP Server (like Apache) installed and ready for action.</description>
